1. Translator.
A translator based on the context.reverso.net web service using the BeautifulSoup library. It allows the user to select 1 of 13 translation languages, translate the specified word from one language to another and get the translation, as well as examples of how the word is used in sentences, and then save the results to a file in the directory where the script file is located.
2. Database To-Do list.
The program creates a "To Do List" database using the SQLAlchemy library, which allows the user to add / delete tasks and deadlines to the database, as well as view the entire list of tasks, tasks for the week, tasks for today and missed tasks. User control of the database is implemented using a menu in which the user can choose between the items he needs.
